It is also being installed on smartphones, and it is expected to be available on more devices in the future. At this time, only images taken with these compatible devices are subject to 'Hardware Proof'."

        "q2": {
            "q": "What is the difference from traditional stock photo sites?",
            "a": "The biggest difference is the 'handling of ownership'. In Web2 services, it is just a record in a database, but in RootLens, ownership is linked to the user's wallet using blockchain (NFT). This enables free buying and selling and transfer of rights, and the true owner can be identified even in the unlikely event of a leak."
        },
        "q3": {
            "q": "Is it 'tamper-proof' thanks to the blockchain?",
            "a": "No. Tamper detection and proof of authenticity of images are realized by 'C2PA' technology itself. The role of the blockchain is to record 'whose' proved content it is and to mobilize rights. By combining these two, both authenticity and ownership are secured."
        },
        "q4": {
            "q": "Why did you choose Solana and Arweave?",
            "a": "Arweave is optimal for permanent storage of image data (large capacity), and Solana's cNFT (compressed NFT) technology was essential for issuing a large number of certificates (NFTs) at low cost. In a model where one certificate is issued per image, low gas fees and processing speed are very important."
